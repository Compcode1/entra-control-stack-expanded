# Entra Control Stack Expanded

## Overview
This repository provides an expanded reference guide to the **Entra Control Stack** — a seven-layer security framework for structuring Microsoft Entra ID governance, identity protection, and continuous verification.  
The content is designed as a consolidated study and operational reference, integrating each layer’s purpose, required Entra elements, implementation actions, and operational notes.

Unlike simulation-based projects, this reference is purely conceptual and instructional. It captures best-practice controls and layer-by-layer recommendations in a consistent, reusable format.

## Structure
The notebook (`brightwave_analytics.ipynb`) is organized into seven core layers:

1. **Authority Definition** – Establish and verify top-level administrative authority and role assignments.  
2. **Scope Boundaries** – Define and enforce role scopes, delegation boundaries, and administrative segmentation.  
3. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM) Controls** – Govern activation, approval, and auditing of privileged roles.  
4. **Role Assignment Governance** – Maintain strict oversight of permanent and eligible role assignments.  
5. **Access Governance** – Implement access reviews, entitlement management, and policy-based provisioning.  
6. **Device Trust Enforcement** – Ensure only secure, compliant devices can access sensitive resources.  
7. **Continuous Verification** – Maintain ongoing assurance through risk-based controls, analytics, and automated reviews.

## Use Cases
- **Study Aid** – Supports SC-300 and AZ-500 exam preparation by aligning with core Entra governance concepts.  
- **Operational Reference** – Serves as a baseline for tenant hardening and identity security architecture.  
- **Governance Mapping** – Facilitates mapping Entra controls to NIST, CIS, and Zero Trust frameworks.
